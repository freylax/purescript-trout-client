# Trout Client

_Automatically derived XHR clients for Trout routing types._

## Usage

```bash
bower install --save purescript-trout-client
```

## Example

The example shows the integration of client and server based on a common
[Trout](https://github.com/owickstrom/purescript-trout) routing type for an
API. AJAX clients are generated by this package for all endpoints, and the
client-side application can safely request resources without having to
duplicate routing information and JSON encoding and decoding instances.

```bash
bower install
(cd example && npm install)
make run-example
```

## Remote Servers

Sometimes you want a client for a remote server.
E.g. you rely on GitHub or use different servers in different environments.
In these cases, you can use `BaseURI` as part of the API:

```PureScript
type API
  = BaseURI
  :> "users"
  :/ Capture "user_id" UserId
  :> Response (Get User JSON)

api :: Proxy API
api = Proxy

user :: forall e. BaseURI -> UserId -> { "GET" :: Aff (ajax :: AJAX | e) User }
user = asClients api
```

When you are ready to use the client,
you pass in the URI of the server as the first argument.

## API Documentation

This library's API documentation is published [on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-trout-client).

## Changelog

* **0.10.0**
  - Added instances for `QueryParam` and `QueryParams`
* **0.8.0**
  - Upgraded to Trout 0.10.0, and all clients are now derived as records, based
    on the named routing types. Specific methods of a resource are accesible
    under the corresponding uppercase field in the resource client record, e.g.
    `site.admin.logs."GET"`.
